        <ul>
            <li>HighSchool Coding</li><p> While i was in <a href="https://www.amphi.com/cdo" class="cdo" target="_blank">CDO HighSchool</a>
            with the 3 years of game development and 1 year of ap computer science. I learned how to write code in HTML, CSS, C++, and Java Script.
            as an added bonus with that i also knew how to code and make working games, Quizzes, and tower defense games. In Scratch, Eclipse, and unity with some
            basic websites made on note pad++ using HTML and CSS, but with unity i was also able to build my own game level while coding it. The
            most impressive thing i did in unity was made a 3d horror maze. Where monster ai will take a path and if you get close enough to their line of sight.
            They would aggro on you and chase you depending how hard the bot was. I really enjoyed my 4 years of coding in school and whish to make it
            into my <em>future career</em>!

            <li>Community Service</li><p>In the summer of 2015. I did about 70 hours of community service and 20 hours of which I did. By helping 
              local PetSmarts and Petcos workers. By walking, feeding, looking after dogs, and take care of the dogs and cats. Then by trying to help
              the poor animal's get adopted as soon as possible, and in doing so we would switch to different pet shops and set up our station there
              so the animals can be seen by more people. the other 50 hours was by working on a ranch to a women who needed help at the time. Over there
              i did a lot of horse care and weed picking. THe different things that i did with the race horses is feeding them, cleaning out there pins
              of poop, groom them with brushes, polish their hoofs, and make sure their saddle is on correctly.
