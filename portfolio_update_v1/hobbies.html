        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gaming</li> <p>My experiences with gaming has been an absolute blast so far. I've been gaming since i was 5 years old.
                When I started to really get into gaming. Is when i played on my dad's wow account in 2005, and ever since then i was addicted
                and attracted to gaming. Over the years playing video games has helped me out a lot. By giving me entertainment, meeting new
                online friends to hang out wih. Chat and play games with, distract me from negative that is happening in my life, and by playing games
                competitive and earning money from tournaments, and so far the best experience with gaming is being able to finally meet you online
                friends in real life. For me gaming has <em>changed my life</em> in the <strong>Best</strong> way possible
            </p>
            <li>Hiking</li> <p>Hiking has always been an amazing experience anytime I do it. If its by myself with friends and or family.
                I personally just love to get out and explore. I have hiked many times up paths into a nice river, nature, and or waterfall.
                my most memorable hike was with my mom, step dad, and two brothers. Every since 2015 i have been visiting my mom in Utah every summer.
                and one summer in 2016 we all followed and hiked the <strong><a href="https://utah.com/hiking/adams-canyon-trail" target="_blank">Adam Canyon Trail</a></strong>
                and after seeing a lot of beautiful senary
