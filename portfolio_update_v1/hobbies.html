        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gaming</li> <p>My experiences with gaming has been an absolute blast so far. I've been gaming since i was 5 years old.
                When I started to really get into gaming. Is when i played on my dad's wow account in 2005, and ever since then i was addicted
                and attracted to gaming. Over the years playing video games has helped me out a lot. By giving me entertainment, meeting new
                online friends to hang out wih. Chat and play games with, distract me from negative that is happening in my life, and by playing games
                competitive and earning money from tournaments, and so far the best experience with gaming is being able to finally meet you online
                friends in real life. For me gaming has changed my life in the <strong>Best</strong> way possible!
            </p>
            <li>Working Out</li> <p>At CDO i really enjoyed taking weight training for my P.E credit. That i took it for all 4 years of highschool
            and I was also lucky enough to get weight training. 2nd period with the same teacher every year. Which was amazing, and like other students
            being super lazy and making the whole class suffer i was a 90 percenter or above and lifted a lot. For some reason I like working out so much
            that I put working out over playing video games its just something in my families lane.background3

            </p>
            <li>Hiking</li> <p>Hiking has always been an amazing experience anytime I do it. If its by myself with friends and or family.
                I personally just love to get out and explore. I have hiked many times up paths into a nice river, nature, and or waterfall.
                my most memorable hike was with my mom, step dad, and two brothers. Every since 2015 i have been visiting my mom in Utah every summer.
                and one summer in 2016 we all followed and hiked the <strong><a href="https://utah.com/hiking/adams-canyon-trail" target="_blank" class="canyon">Adam Canyon Trail</a></strong>
                and after seeing a lot of beautiful senary you get rewarded nicely at the end of the hike with a beautiful waterfall, and then on the way down
                is a nice fast trip.
            </p>
            <li>Gardening</li><p>Whenever I was at my grandparents house and had a chance to help them garden i would. Going more into that they have 2
                vine trees, pine tree, orange tree, oak tree and then we had 3 different types of climbers 3 different types of Annuals with much more potted
                plants that i have forgotten the name of. Then over at my moms grandmas house in Utah she had a lot of different colored roses and dandelions
                and my job once of week their was to clip off any dead or eaten(by snails and slugs) flower that was on the bush.
            </p>
            <li>Collecting Deck of Cards</li><p>Ever since i was young i loved all board and card games. Then when i was in middle school i played a lot of online
                card games like uno, texas holden, 5 hand poker, ect... WHich is what really inspired and made me fall in love with table top card games. Fast 
                foward when i was in highschool i would always bring a deck of cards to play kings corner, garbage, rat slap, castle, war, gold fish, golf, 
                poker and texas holden, and  a card game i made up but lost the composition book for. Within the time of middle school to highschool (2011-2018)
                i got many cards durning my Birthday and Christmas, so far i have 15 different type of cards ranging from different brands, styles to them being plastic
                and cardboard. My favorite deck of cards i own currently is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cards-Arrow-Playing-Bridge-Regular/dp/B000WH5HYA/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=plastic+black+and+gold+casino+playing+cards+2+pack&qid=1595919467&sr=8-6" target="_blank"></a>
                I've had and been using them for the last 4 years and still work great!
