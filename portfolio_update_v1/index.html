        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer that got most of my inspiration from my dad, and from that in Highschool i took 2 years of game development,
          and 2 years of computer science. In that process i learned how to build and code in unity, Scratch, and Eclipse. After doing so
        i still really enjoyed what i was doing. In return brought me to Treehouse.</p>
